\description{
Processes a list of RDS objects containing real-time GTFS feed queries saved throughout the day, extracting relevant information and performing data transformations.
}
\details{
The `process_vp_list_rds` function takes a list of RDS objects, each representing a real-time GTFS feed query saved at different points throughout the day. The function processes these objects to extract relevant information and apply necessary data transformations.

The function starts by combining the RDS objects with their corresponding names using the `pmap` function from the `purrr` package. It extracts the query batch timestamp by removing the "data_vp_" prefix and the ".rds" extension from the names and converting the resulting character strings to datetime objects with the "US/Pacific" timezone.

The processed data is then combined using the `reduce` function from the `purrr` package and renamed using the `rename_with` function. The renaming step replaces "vehicle.id" with "vehicle_id" in the column names and retains only the portion after the last dot in the remaining column names.

The data is arranged by the query batch timestamp, route ID, vehicle ID, and trip ID using the `arrange` function from the `dplyr` package. It is then grouped by the route ID, vehicle ID, and trip ID using the `group_by` function.

Additional computations are performed within each group using the `mutate` function. The `date_time` column is derived from the `timestamp` column by converting it to numeric format, then to datetime format using the `lubridate::as_datetime` function, and finally applying the "US/Pacific" timezone using the `lubridate::with_tz` function.

The `datetime_diff` column is calculated as the difference in seconds between consecutive `date_time` values using the `lag` function. Finally, the data is ungrouped and converted back to a data.frame using the `data.frame` function. Rows with a `datetime_diff` of zero are filtered out to remove redundant or duplicate entries.

This function facilitates the processing and transformation of real-time GTFS feed query data, enabling further analysis and visualization of the queried information.
